# 🎯 Athena

> **AI-Driven C5ISR Command Platform for Cyber Operations**

Athena transforms penetration testing from tactical tool operation 
to strategic military command. Built on the C5ISR (Command, Control, 
Communications, Computers, Cyber, Intelligence, Surveillance, 
Reconnaissance) framework, Athena bridges MITRE Caldera's execution 
power with AI-assisted decision-making.

## 🌟 Why Athena?

Traditional penetration testing tools focus on **"how to exploit"**.  
Athena focuses on **"how to command"**.

- **Not a tool** - A command-and-control decision platform
- **Not scripts** - A military operational framework  
- **Not static** - OODA loop-driven dynamic adaptation
- **Not technical-only** - Strategic + tactical integration
